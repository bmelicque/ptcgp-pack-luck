# Pokemon TCG Pocket 'luck-o-meter'

A simple tool to measure how lucky you've been with you're pack openings.

## What is this project for?

I've been looking for a way to train on statistical distributions.
People have been complaining a lot about PTCGP's pull rates, so I thought it would be a good starting point.

Just put in how many packs you opened and how many rare cards you got, result is purely visual.

## About the docs

The `/docs` folder doesn't really hold any documentation, it's just a hack for hosting it on GitHub Pages.

## Running it locally

Install the dependencies:

`npm i`

Then run it:

`npm run dev`
